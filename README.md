The purpose of Cinescope is:

- The user can see all popular movies available
- The user can view movies by genre
- The user can add movies to their list and view them as well
- The user search for movies by title, year, or both
- When the user searches for a specific movie, posters of that title or similar will be displayed
- As the user clicks on a movie poster, information such as:
   - Title
   - Genre(s)
   - Release Year
   - Runtime
   - IMDb Rating
   - Plot Overview
   - Director(s)
   - Writer(s)
   - Stars
   - Trailer button
   - My List button

- When the user clicks on the movie poster, it will take them to the imdb listing for that movie
- When the user clicks on the "Trailer" button, it will take them to a link for the trailer
- When the user clicks on the "My List" button, it will add that specific movie to their list


To retrieve data for the movies, I am using the OMDb API (https://www.omdbapi.com)

I built the application using:

Software: VS Code

Design: Figma

Languages/Frameworks: Vue.JS, Vanilla CSS, Tailwind CSS

API: OMDb API
